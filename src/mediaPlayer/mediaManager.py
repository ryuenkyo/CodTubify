"""
This module implements the PlaylistManager class, which is basically the logic of a "playlist" made using circular doubly linked list.
It provides methods to interact with the playlist, such as adding songs, removing songs, changing the current song, and moving to the next or previous song.
We use this class in the MusicPlayer class to manage the playlist of songs.
this class also manages the MP3 inputs for soundController.py which is further imported in Player.py
